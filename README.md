## Assignment 7: Filtered Todo List using Recoil

In Assignment 7, I implemented a filtered todo list using Recoil for state management in my React project. Here are the key features and components:

### Features

- **Add Todo**: Implemented functionality to add new todo items with a title and description.
- **Display Todos**: Created a component to display the list of todos.
- **Filter Todos**: Implemented a filter functionality to filter todos based on certain criteria using Recoil atoms and selectors.

### Components

- **Todo**: Main component for adding new todos and displaying the todo list.
- **TodoRender**: Component responsible for rendering the list of todos with filtering functionality.
- **Recoil Atoms**: Used Recoil atoms to manage the state of the todo list and filters.

### Technologies Used

- React
- Recoil

## Conclusion

Completing Assignment 7 was a great learning experience, and it helped me understand the benefits of using Recoil for state management in React applications. I successfully implemented a filtered todo list with add, display, and filter functionalities using Recoil atoms and selectors.
